        <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Highlighters All These Years </h1>
        <h2>Director Demands Investigation</h2>

            LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the<br> CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.<br><br>
            
            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are<br> marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that<br> began at the agency's inception in 1947.<br><br>
            
            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several<br> historic events, such as:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
